Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm. That is what this project sets out to achieve.


The Project
---

**Step 1:** Install Dependencies
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib

**Step 2:** Open Jupyter Notebook
The code for this project is in the Jupyter Notebook "find_lane_lines.ipynb"

If you use anaconda, you can launch Jupyterlab/Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda Navigator by selecting your environment and clicking "Launch." Or else, you can enable your environment and launch Jupyterlab/ Jupyter Notebook from the console with
'>jupyter notebook'

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.  Click on the file called "find_lane_lines.ipynb".
